A toolkit for creating multilingual web applications on ASP.NET Core. It offers a suite of configurable localisation middleware, including request culture validators, cookie management, exception handlers, and URL rewriting rules, that wrap and extend the framework's native [globalisation and localisation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/localization?view=aspnetcore-2.1) functions to take the pain out of building localised websites.

The library was developed at [Fiontar & Scoil na Gaeilge](https://www.gaois.ie), Dublin City University, Ireland where we use it to build our own multilingual web applications.

**Note:** This is a **prerelease version** for testing purposes. Expect some breaking changes and renamed API methods before we reach a 1.0 release.
